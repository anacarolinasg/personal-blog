                    <h3>What did I learnt from previous relationships</h3>

                    <p class="text-paragraph"> 
                            When you are in a relationship you are <em>always learning something.</em>
                            <br> <br>
                            Sometimes it’s a pleasurable learning, sometimes don´t. But If I could hightlight the most important thing that I ever learned about relationships I would say that it was the understanding ( and acceptance ) <strong>that nobody is perfect</strong>. No matter how hard you search, the perfect guy/girl does not exist. The good news is, maybe this can be the secret to a <em>truly happy relationship.</em>
                            <br><br>
                            When you accept how imperfect people are (including yourself) you tend to be more understanding, since you will know that mistakes are a natural part of an imperfect human being. From this understating, comes forgiveness. By forgiving, you achieve humility, and so on.
                            <br><br>Another important thing is that you are always learning something new. Humans are unique, so you’ll always find new challenges to deal with at new relationships. It’s important to open your mind to your partner and never judge him by a previous one.
                            <br><br>And, of course, the most important thing that everybody must learn about relationships: <strong>love yourself first.</strong>
